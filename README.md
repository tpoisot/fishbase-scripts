# fishbase-scripts

Scripts to interact with the fishbase API

Ideally, each use-case would be done in python and R, and possibly other languages

See the main API repo: [https://github.com/royrusso/fishbase]

(*more to come*)

## Recommended toolkit

For `R`: the `httr` library

For `python`: the `requests` library ([http://docs.python-requests.org/en/latest/])

For `julia`: The `Requests` package (`Pkg.add("Requests")`), and the `JSON` package
